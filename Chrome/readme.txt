to install, simply drag the .crx file inside an open browser window.
since chrome does not allow unsigned extensions and publishing to Chrome Web Store requires paying a fee, the extension will not be usable after installing.
if you still want to use the extension, open chrome://extensions in your browser, enable developer mode and load the extension from the provided source folder inside source.zip.
the popup upon launching chrome can still get annoying, though. to avoid this, use developer distributions of chrome such as canary or chromium.
